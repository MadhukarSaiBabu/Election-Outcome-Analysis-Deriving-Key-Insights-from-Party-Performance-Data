# Election-Outcome-Analysis-Deriving-Key-Insights-from-Party-Performance-Data
This project aims to analyze election performance data of various political parties to derive meaningful insights from the number of seats won and currently leading. By leveraging structured data containing columns for seats won, seats leading, and total seats, the study performs a series of quantitative analyses to assess party performance.

The analysis begins with fundamental statistics such as the total number of seats won and leading by all parties. It identifies the party with the most seats won and the party currently leading in the most constituencies. A ranking of the top 5 parties by total seats (won + leading) is also generated to highlight major contenders in the election.

Further statistical evaluations include the percentage share of total seats won by each party, the average and median number of seats won per party, and the distribution of seats won, offering insights into the variability and concentration of political influence.

The project also presents a comparative analysis between the top 2 parties, examining both won and leading seats to uncover competitive dynamics.

Overall, this analytical approach provides a comprehensive view of party performance in the election, equipping political analysts, journalists, and the public with actionable, data-driven insights. It also sets a foundation for further exploration into voting trends, regional performance, and predictive modeling for future elections.
